| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party is interviewed by [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. They admit to breaking into [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]] and infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] returns to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]], where he reads a coded message from the Korranberg Chronicle using a cipher. He leaves a dossier concerning the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack at a dead drop location, only holding back concerns over [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s strange capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/001\|001]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] deals with customers at [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in the [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]], a Cyran refugee neighborhood in [[Places/Lower Tavick's Landing\|Lower Tavick's Landing]]. He is visited by [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]], a member of the [[Lore/Boromar Clan\|Boromar Clan]]. Gus shakes him down for money owed and invites him to the Five Lives play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
