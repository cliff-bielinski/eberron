| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] meet up. Jacopo stabs a statue of [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] and drinks the blood.

He sees the aberrant marked tyrant [[Characters/Halas Tarkanan\|Halas Tarkanan]], with Sharn teeming with vermin from the [[Characters/Lady of the Plague\|Lady of the Plague]]. Finally, he sees a future of Sharn derelict and empty. He collects some of Aureon's blood in a vial. Nazari stabs [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Dol Dorn]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
