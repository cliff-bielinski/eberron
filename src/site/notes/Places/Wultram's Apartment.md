| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | <ul><li>The party is interviewed by [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. They admit to breaking into [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]] and infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | <ul><li>The Sharn Inquisitive is delivered covering the undead attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. It also mentions the arrest of a Warforged for killing a man. The Party infers that it is a reference to [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] and Jonas, the man previously detained in [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]].</li><li>Unable to cure Nazari's undead affliction, [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] visit [[Characters/Suyamun\|Suyamun]] at the Riedran embassy in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]] for help, where he successfully cleanses her disease. The twins tell Suyamun about their exploits at [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]], the [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]], and their interest in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. He doesn't have much to offer in information, but vows to look into what sort of person may have sold the dragonshards to [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | <ul><li>The Party arrive at [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] and find a crooked tower matching the address for [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]]. They break in and find a pair of wooden cages: one, with a ghoul; and the other, with a gaunt man named Jonas. After questioning him, the Party realizes he had been captured and deliberately scratched by a ghoul. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] surmises this could be a Karrnathi attempt at creating self-replicating undead.</li><li>After failed healing attempts, the Party ask [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] to take Jonas to a Jorasco house while they investigate the rest of [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]].</li><li>The Party find a spellbook alongside three large [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]] in [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]]: an Eberron, a Siberys and a Khyber dragonshard. They surmise this was a ritual for summoning undead.</li><li>[[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] steps through the summoning circle and three flaming skulls animate and attack the Party. The skulls are dispatched but the apartment lights on fire, forcing the group to flee as [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]] burns down with any remaining evidence.</li></ul> |
