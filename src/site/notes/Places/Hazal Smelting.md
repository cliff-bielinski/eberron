| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | Leaving [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]], the party finds [[Characters/Ignus\|Ignus]] a fire elemental from [[Places/Fernia\|Fernia]] likely pulled through the Fernian gate opened by Cinder. Ignus is excited by the prospect of joining a murder investigation and joins the party, gravitating toward Cinder due to his Fernian connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | The party head to [[Places/Talos's Apartment\|Talos's Apartment]] for the night, where they have an actual party. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognizes Lan's mask from [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] as a "psychopomp mask" to ward off death. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] talks about the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and their view of death as oblivion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | At the [[Places/Red Hammer Inn\|Red Hammer Inn]], [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] approaches [[Characters/Scythe\|Scythe]] for information about [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. He learns about employee movement and a shift change to a "skeleton crew" that occurs at 8pm. Scythe also blames the party for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]'s predicament and demands "blood money" for Cinder keeping company with "slavers".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | The Party stakes out [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] and discuss strategy. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] reveals that she is a changeling, and transforms into a Karrnathi worker. The foreman (later known to be [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]]) lets her into the facility, but waits at the door for her return. She quickly heads upstairs and grabs a key and some documents from an office.  Bargast goes in after her and she changes into him in an attempt to leave. She creates confusion amongst the workers before morphing into Gristle and scampering off.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] returns to the Party with the key and documents from [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. The documents include correspondence with [[Characters/Kelthor d'Tharashk\|Kelthor d'Tharashk]] negotiating the purchase of [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | The Party infiltrates [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. They discover the "skeleton crew" are actual skeletons. The crew is run by an undead minion called [[Characters/The Night Shift\|The Night Shift]] and his fiery gremlin Flicker. Using misdirection, the party successfully sneak past the undead and head to [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | The Party turns over [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office. They find a safe (which they take after failing to open it), a set of black robes and obsidian mask, and a letter to the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] discussing a midnight meeting at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. The Party finds more masks and robes and create a few distractions to escape [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] largely unnoticed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | The Party speaks to [[Characters/Blue\|Blue]], who gives them the location of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. He also warns them that Lan only hires Karrnathi and that there are rumors that he uses an undead workforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
