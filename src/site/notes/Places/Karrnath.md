| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | Back at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] reunites with the party and updates them. Some in the party recognize [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] as a Brelish war hero who lost his arm fighting Karrnathi. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reminds the party to **always lawyer up** when dealing with the authorities. The party debate what to do and decide to cooperate/negotiate with the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] in the ongoing investigation.                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | The Party stakes out [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] and discuss strategy. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] reveals that she is a changeling, and transforms into a Karrnathi worker. The foreman (later known to be [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]]) lets her into the facility, but waits at the door for her return. She quickly heads upstairs and grabs a key and some documents from an office.  Bargast goes in after her and she changes into him in an attempt to leave. She creates confusion amongst the workers before morphing into Gristle and scampering off.                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | The Party splits up. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] finds his Karrnathi drinking buddy [[Characters/Vlad\|Vlad]].

He also learns that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is a Karrnathi industrialist who owns smelting facilities in the [[Places/Cogs\|Cogs]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | The Party speaks to [[Characters/Blue\|Blue]], who gives them the location of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. He also warns them that Lan only hires Karrnathi and that there are rumors that he uses an undead workforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The Party take sky coaches to [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], a Karrnathi enclave within [[Places/Middle Tavick's Landing\|Middle Tavick's Landing]]. In transit, members of the party learn that [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] hates "gobos" and that [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] fought for Cyre - on opposite sides of the War to [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The Party arrive at [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] and find a crooked tower matching the address for [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]]. They break in and find a pair of wooden cages: one, with a ghoul; and the other, with a gaunt man named Jonas. After questioning him, the Party realizes he had been captured and deliberately scratched by a ghoul. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] surmises this could be a Karrnathi attempt at creating self-replicating undead.                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The Party discovers that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] was a former Blademark of [[Lore/House Deneith\|House Deneith]]. They find a receipt for the bag and crossbow from a man named [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]], as well as a letter from Lan praising Wultram's service to Karrnathi ideals. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] finds a pendant of the [[Lore/Order of the Emerald Claw\|Order of the Emerald Claw]] and a manifesto espousing Karrnathi supremacy and calling for a return to war.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] searches the raving mad man who unleashed the bag of undead in the theatre. He learns that the man is a Karrnathi named [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] attempts to mind link with Wultram and is rebuffed by an entity telling him he has no place in this man's mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

In particular, Gus wants evidence that Wultram was working for someone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/001\|001]] | Five Lives is about the War. Five scenes unfold. At the climactic moment in the final scene, a crossbow bolt hits [[Characters/Alison Mediri\|Alison Mediri]] and kills her. A crazy old man shouts "Death to Breland! Glory to Karrnath!" before throwing open a bag of undead at the audience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
