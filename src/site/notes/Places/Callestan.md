| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | #SayNoToDrugs #Daask [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] heads to [[Places/The Dribbling Mug\|The Dribbling Mug]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]], where he encounters the goblin street urchin [[Characters/Vicky\|Vicky]] and shifter [[Characters/Scritch\|Scritch]]. After providing them food, Gristle asks for [[Characters/Chib\|Chib]], as to get in on the [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] that the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] were moving. Vicky points him to the nearby gargoyle [[Characters/Coldstone\|Coldstone]], who states the product has already been sold, but he would convey Gristle's interest to [[Characters/Cazha\|Cazha]].                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #SayNoToDrugs #VanquishingVampireMommy #BoromarClan The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission. |
