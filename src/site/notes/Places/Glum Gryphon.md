| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The fleeing party members are chased by the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] militia, led by a man they would later recognize to be [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. The Party escape using feather tokens and jumping off a nearby bridge (except for [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], who shape changes to escape). They regroup at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. The rest of the Party questions how Lark was able to get away without jumping. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The Party splits up for the night. [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] stay at [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] attempts to heal [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]]'s ghoul wound at their run-down apartment. At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] plays a traditional Cyran song to comfort [[Characters/Angelica Mediri\|Angelica Mediri]].                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | #TerrorInSharn The party (plus [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]], [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gus]], and [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]) head to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to decompress after the attack at the theatre. After some debate, they decide to open the bag of holding in an alleyway. Besides learning that the bag is of [[Lore/House Kundarak\|House Kundarak]] make, they find nothing but sloughed off rotten flesh.                                  |
