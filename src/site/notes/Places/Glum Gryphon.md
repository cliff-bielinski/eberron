| ยง                                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] returns and is coaxed back into Lark with some tatertots from [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s canonical chest oven. She updates the party about the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] suggests they murder some Daask. The rest of the party is horrified and worried about retribution from a criminal gang. Jacopo is more concerned that [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] might kill him if this situation is not quickly rectified. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | Back at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] reunites with the party and updates them. Some in the party recognize [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] as a Brelish war hero who lost his arm fighting Karrnathi. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reminds the party to **always lawyer up** when dealing with the authorities. The party debate what to do and decide to cooperate/negotiate with the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] in the ongoing investigation.                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]] reverts [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] to Lark by punching her in the face. He and Lark then properly introduce themselves to the rest of the party. In an alley outside the tavern, the party smashes open [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe and finds only workers' wages in gold and silver and some small [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]].                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] becomes worried when [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] doesn't return to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. She transforms into Gristle and heads to [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]], where she meets with Gristle's [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] contacts. She is unable to find out anything useful.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | The Party reconvenes at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to share their findings. They speculate the attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] could have been an attempt to plant the seeds of an undead outbreak in the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | Back at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] gets [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]]'s advice on helping [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. He cautions her against a deceptive solution, given the differences between warforged and changelings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The fleeing party members are chased by the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] militia, led by a man they would later recognize to be [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. The Party escape using feather tokens and jumping off a nearby bridge (except for [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], who shape changes to escape). They regroup at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. The rest of the Party questions how Lark was able to get away without jumping.                                                              |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The Party splits up for the night. [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] stay at [[Places/Talos's Apartment\|Talos's Apartment]] in [[Places/Upper Menthis\|Upper Menthis]]. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] attempts to heal [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]]'s ghoul wound at their run-down apartment. At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] plays a traditional Cyran song to comfort [[Characters/Angelica Mediri\|Angelica Mediri]].                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | The party (plus [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]], [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gus]], and [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]) head to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to decompress after the attack at the theatre. After some debate, they decide to open the bag of holding in an alleyway. Besides learning that the bag is of [[Lore/House Kundarak\|House Kundarak]] make, they find nothing but sloughed off rotten flesh.                                                                                                              |
