After providing them food, Gristle asks for [[Characters/Chib\|Chib]], as to get in on the [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] that the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] were moving. Vicky points him to the nearby gargoyle [[Characters/Coldstone\|Coldstone]], who states the product has already been sold, but he would convey Gristle's interest to [[Characters/Cazha\|Cazha]]. |
