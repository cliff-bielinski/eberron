| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn After leaving [[Characters/Ignus\|Ignus]] behind to exfiltrate himself, the party dons their robes and masks and enters a series of tunnels through the trapdoor. They join a growing stream of cultists. At the entrance to the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], each cultist is given a candle, a knife, and a cryptic message about rebellion against the gods. The party is separated and enter the Shrine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodOfVol The following day, [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] heads to [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] library and researches the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. She doesn't find out much regarding shrines in [[Places/Sharn\|Sharn]] but learns about the importance of blood in Blood of Vol rituals. She also learns that Seekers rituals manage the destructive impact of [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party turns over [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office. They find a safe (which they take after failing to open it), a set of black robes and obsidian mask, and a letter to the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] discussing a midnight meeting at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. The Party finds more masks and robes and create a few distractions to escape [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] largely unnoticed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
