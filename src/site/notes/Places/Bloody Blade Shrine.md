| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn As undead swarm into the inner cloister of the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] attempts to mind link with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]]. Not knowing it as friendly, he rebuffs her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords The party and [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] regroup after the fight. [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #ManifestMayhem #ThePlightOfPyramus #BloodOfVol #KingsSwords [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] implores [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad") to find [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and preserve the [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] apologizes for calling in the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] early, but is reassured by Captain Buchanan. Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning.                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #ShadyShadow #HouseJorasco The party takes [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] to see [[Characters/Minka d'Jorasco\|Minka d'Jorasco]] after everything that went down at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. She gives him a clean bill of health except calls his missing shadow "probably some fey shit."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn The party is separated as they enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. In addition to a lit candle and a dagger, each party member was given a phrase associated with a god of the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]. They discover that the undead wandering the Shrine avoid their candlelight, which seems magical and can't be augmented despite [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s best attempt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] aids a cultist in killing some undead. After passing a few statues she finds [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Olladra]] and stabs it. She gets a vision of a wasteland with obsidian spires, reminiscent of a feyspire like the elvish birthplace [[Places/Shae Tirias Tolai\|Shae Tirias Tolai]]. Lark realizes the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] might be in a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabaran]] manifest zone. She drinks more blood and sees a vision of a fey court with its flowers wilting and creatures turning to dust. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] arrives and stops her from stabbing the statue over and over again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] ask the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] assembly to all donate blood to perform a clarifying ritual over events that have recently transpired.  [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] slips [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] the vial of blood from the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] statue. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] pretends to faint, knocking over the basin of collected blood. When they insist on getting her blood, she hurls the basin at [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] and snaps her [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] coin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] pop into the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. They arrest cultists including [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] attempts to apprehend [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] but he is thwarted as she shrouds the room in darkness, allowing the undead outside the door to gain strength and break into the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn After leaving [[Characters/Ignus\|Ignus]] behind to exfiltrate himself, the party dons their robes and masks and enters a series of tunnels through the trapdoor. They join a growing stream of cultists. At the entrance to the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], each cultist is given a candle, a knife, and a cryptic message about rebellion against the gods. The party is separated and enter the Shrine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodOfVol The following day, [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] heads to [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] library and researches the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. She doesn't find out much regarding shrines in [[Places/Sharn\|Sharn]] but learns about the importance of blood in Blood of Vol rituals. She also learns that Seekers rituals manage the destructive impact of [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party turns over [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office. They find a safe (which they take after failing to open it), a set of black robes and obsidian mask, and a letter to the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] discussing a midnight meeting at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. The Party finds more masks and robes and create a few distractions to escape [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] largely unnoticed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
