| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/001\|001]] | Five Lives is about the War. Five scenes unfold. At the climactic moment in the final scene, a crossbow bolt hits [[Characters/Alison Mediri\|Alison Mediri]] and kills her. A crazy old man shouts "Death to Breland! Glory to Karrnath!" before throwing open a bag of undead at the audience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
