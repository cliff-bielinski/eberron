| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning.                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] learns he is a person of interest in the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attack. He answers a summons from the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] for questioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #SayNoToDrugs [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] questions [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] about his relationship to [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]], and why Gus is interested in the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. Jacopo suggests Gus is interested in the greater good of Sharn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #TerrorInSharn #ThePlightOfPyramus The Sharn Inquisitive is delivered covering the undead attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. It also mentions the arrest of a warforged for killing a man. The Party infers that it is a reference to [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] and Jonas, the man previously detained in [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #InternationalManOfMystery [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] returns to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]], where he reads a coded message from the Korranberg Chronicle using a cipher. He leaves a dossier concerning the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack at a dead drop location, only holding back concerns over [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s strange capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party reconvenes at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to share their findings. They speculate the attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] could have been an attempt to plant the seeds of an undead outbreak in the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
