| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The Party take sky coaches to [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], a Karrnathi enclave within [[Places/Middle Tavick's Landing\|Middle Tavick's Landing]]. In transit, members of the party learn that [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] hates "gobos" and that [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] fought for Cyre - on opposite sides of the War to [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party arrive at [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] and find a crooked tower matching [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s address. They break in and find a pair of wooden cages: one, with a ghoul; and the other, with a gaunt man named Jonas. After questioning him, the Party realizes he had been captured and deliberately scratched by a ghoul. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] surmises this could be a Karrnathi attempt at creating self-replicating undead. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The fleeing party members are chased by the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] militia, led by a man they would later recognize to be [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. The Party escape using feather tokens and jumping off a nearby bridge (except for [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], who shape changes to escape). They regroup at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. The rest of the Party questions how Lark was able to get away without jumping.                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | #BoromarClan #TerrorInSharn  [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] asks the party to investigate [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s house in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], a Karrnathi neighborhood of [[Places/Middle Tavick's Landing\|Middle Tavick's Landing]]. In particular, Gus wants evidence that Wultram was working for someone else.                                                                                                                                                                           |
