| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn The party returns to [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment and plan to infiltrate [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] wonders if the discs given to them by the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] are being used to spy on the party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], disguised as the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]], assists the party in successfully infiltrating [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. In his apartment, they find a set up game of Conqueror, financial documents, a [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] book and a dagger that doubles as a key to a hidden trapdoor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The Party take sky coaches to [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], a Karrnathi enclave within [[Places/Middle Tavick's Landing\|Middle Tavick's Landing]]. In transit, members of the party learn that [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] hates "gobos" and that [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] fought for Cyre - on opposite sides of the War to [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party arrive at [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] and find a crooked tower matching [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s address. They break in and find a pair of wooden cages: one, with a ghoul; and the other, with a gaunt man named Jonas. After questioning him, the Party realizes he had been captured and deliberately scratched by a ghoul. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] surmises this could be a Karrnathi attempt at creating self-replicating undead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The fleeing party members are chased by the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] militia, led by a man they would later recognize to be [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. The Party escape using feather tokens and jumping off a nearby bridge (except for [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], who shape changes to escape). They regroup at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. The rest of the Party questions how Lark was able to get away without jumping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | #BoromarClan #TerrorInSharn  [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] asks the party to investigate [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s house in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], a Karrnathi neighborhood of [[Places/Middle Tavick's Landing\|Middle Tavick's Landing]]. In particular, Gus wants evidence that Wultram was working for someone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
