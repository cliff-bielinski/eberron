| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | Unable to cure Nazari's undead affliction, [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] visit [[Characters/Suyamun\|Suyamun]] at the Riedran embassy in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]] for help, where he successfully cleanses her disease. The twins tell Suyamun about their exploits at [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]], the [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]], and their interest in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. He doesn't have much to offer in information, but vows to look into what sort of person may have sold the dragonshards to [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
