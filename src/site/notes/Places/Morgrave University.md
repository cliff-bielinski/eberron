| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #VanquishingVampireMommy The party heads to [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] to research vampires. They learn vampire spawn are created and controlled by existing vampires; that they have weaknesses to sunlight but are immune to disease, paralysis, and sleep; they are resistant to ordinary weapons, but are affected by silver blades; that they can quickly restore their health; that they rest in coffins; that they are only rejuvenated by drinking blood directly from a person that they haven’t already fed from within the last few days; that they can turn into bats, wolves, or mist; that they can dominate others; and that transforming into a spawn requires a ritual performed upon a person killed by a vampire bite. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] reveals to the party he is not a student at [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]], and instead is an experimental warforged (alongside [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]]) that is able to forge a connection to other planes and draw on their powers. He is nervous about [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]'s interest in him. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reassures him that Merrix has progressive views about warforged autonomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodOfVol The following day, [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] heads to [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] library and researches the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. She doesn't find out much regarding shrines in [[Places/Sharn\|Sharn]] but learns about the importance of blood in Blood of Vol rituals. She also learns that Seekers rituals manage the destructive impact of [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] questions [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] about his [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] cover story. Cinder expresses worry about drawing the attention of [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]. Talos reassures him of Merrix's progressive views toward warforged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] is caught attempting to break into [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]]. He runs from the guards with no success in furthering the investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
