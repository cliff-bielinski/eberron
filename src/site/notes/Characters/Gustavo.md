| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs #BoromarClan [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] tells the party he started a brothel called the [[Places/Three-Legged Halfling\|Three-Legged Halfling]] in [[Places/Kalazart\|Kalazart]] alongside his former lover [[Characters/Mercedes Boromar\|Mercedes Boromar]]. She presumably died in the [[Lore/Day of Mourning\|Day of Mourning]]. Jacopo leveraged that relationship to get in with her cousin [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]]. Jacopo reveals he owes Gus both money and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] after being mugged by "unknown" enemies. The party brainstorms how to handle Gus.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #SayNoToDrugs #VanquishingVampireMommy #BoromarClan The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs #BoromarClan [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] laments the absence of [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] product being moved in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] admits he got jacked of his dreamlily and has been unable to develop a clientele in Highwall. Gus demands that Jacopo focus on the dreamlily situation once [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] is dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #SayNoToDrugs [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] questions [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] about his relationship to [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]], and why Gus is interested in the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. Jacopo suggests Gus is interested in the greater good of Sharn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | #TerrorInSharn #BoromarClan #SharnCityWatch The [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] arrive, including the detective [[Characters/Eskridge Callaway\|Eskridge Callaway]] and the journalist [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] hides the bag of holding that was used to unleash the undead. The detectives are suspicious of the party after [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] mentions the now missing bag. [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gus]] pulls strings and convinces the guards to let the issue slide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

After some debate, they decide to open the bag of holding in an alleyway. Besides learning that the bag is of [[Lore/House Kundarak\|House Kundarak]] make, they find nothing but sloughed off rotten flesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In particular, Gus wants evidence that Wultram was working for someone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
