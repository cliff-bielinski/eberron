| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] reveals to the party he is not a student at [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]], and instead is an experimental warforged (alongside [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]]) that is able to forge a connection to other planes and draw on their powers. He is nervous about [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]'s interest in him. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reassures him that Merrix has progressive views about warforged autonomy.                                           |
