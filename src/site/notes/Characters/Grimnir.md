| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]] reverts [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] to Lark by punching her in the face. He and Lark then properly introduce themselves to the rest of the party. In an alley outside the tavern, the party smashes open [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe and finds only workers' wages in gold and silver and some small [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]]. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | Back at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] gets [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]]'s advice on helping [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. He cautions her against a deceptive solution, given the differences between warforged and changelings.                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | The party (plus [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]], [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gus]], and [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]) head to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to decompress after the attack at the theatre. After some debate, they decide to open the bag of holding in an alleyway. Besides learning that the bag is of [[Lore/House Kundarak\|House Kundarak]] make, they find nothing but sloughed off rotten flesh.        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/001\|001]] | [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]], a rat shifter, steals tickets to the play. He shapeshifts into Lark and discusses the play with [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]], another changeling. Lark is interested in the fey connection of the playwright.                                                                                                                            |
