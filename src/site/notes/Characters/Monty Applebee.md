[[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper. |

[[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] hides the bag of holding that was used to unleash the undead. The detectives are suspicious of the party after [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] mentions the now missing bag.
