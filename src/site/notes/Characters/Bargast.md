| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], disguised as the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]], assists the party in successfully infiltrating [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]] in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. In his apartment, they find a set up game of Conqueror, financial documents, a [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] book and a dagger that doubles as a key to a hidden trapdoor.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party stakes out [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] and discuss strategy. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] reveals that she is a changeling, and transforms into a Karrnathi worker. The foreman (later known to be [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]]) lets her into the facility, but waits at the door for her return. She quickly heads upstairs and grabs a key and some documents from an office.  Bargast goes in after her and she changes into him in an attempt to leave. She creates confusion amongst the workers before morphing into Gristle and scampering off. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party turns over [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office. They find a safe (which they take after failing to open it), a set of black robes and obsidian mask, and a letter to the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] discussing a midnight meeting at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. The Party finds more masks and robes and create a few distractions to escape [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] largely unnoticed.                                                                                                                                          |
