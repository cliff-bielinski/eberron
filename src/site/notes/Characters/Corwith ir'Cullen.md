| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] arrives at [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]]'s apartment, bringing an invitation for the party from [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]]. The two of them spar with wooden swords before banging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party head to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] and meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] and Lord [[Characters/Clayton ir'Cullen\|Clayton ir'Cullen]]. Lord ir'Cullen congratulates the party on the mission against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. He ignores the party's concern about the still-at-large [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and feels that Lan (and the cultists!) are definitely guilty. The party learns that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] (reportedly) killed himself shortly after confessing Lan's involvement in the plot. Buchanan reassures the party that the Shrine is under close guard. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] makes the connection that Lord ir'Cullen is [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]'s father.                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | Back at [[Places/Talos's Apartment\|Talos's Apartment]], the party discusses next steps. They theorize about [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s "suicide". Could it have been [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]? Or maybe the mysterious voice [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] heard in Wultram's head? Maybe it was just plain suicide. The Party strategizes about both how to approach the [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] interrogation as well as the [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] situation, including how to prioritize information-gathering versus killing her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | The party encounters [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] in [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]]. She shakes [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]'s hand. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] flirts with [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and they arrange a "spar" later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets up with the Party the following morning. She explains her suspicion that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is innocent and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] may have a hidden agenda. She plans to track [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] under the pretext of providing sustenance. She warns [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] to avoid [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]. The party is somewhat skeptical of Lark's supposition that the King's Swords are up to something nefarious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] pop into the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. They arrest cultists including [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] attempts to apprehend [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] but he is thwarted as she shrouds the room in darkness, allowing the undead outside the door to gain strength and break into the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]] in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] is questioned by [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] of the King's Swords about his absence at work, the party's activities, and his knowledge of [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. Zelandris attempts to lie but is caught, and reveals some of their activities (but still hiding [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]]'s true nature).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] comes to [[Places/Medieval Times\|Medieval Times]] and questions [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] about the party's actions and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. She successfully deflects his questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
