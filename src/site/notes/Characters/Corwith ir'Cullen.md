| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #HouseMedani #KingsSwords The party encounters [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. She shakes [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]'s hand. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] flirts with [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and they arrange a "spar" later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets up with the Party the following morning. She explains her suspicion that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is innocent and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] may have a hidden agenda. She plans to track [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] under the pretext of providing sustenance. She warns [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] to avoid [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]. The party is somewhat skeptical of Lark's supposition that the King's Swords are up to something nefarious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] pop into the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. They arrest cultists including [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] attempts to apprehend [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] but he is thwarted as she shrouds the room in darkness, allowing the undead outside the door to gain strength and break into the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] is questioned by [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] of the King's Swords about his absence at work, the party's activities, and his knowledge of [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. Zelandris attempts to lie but is caught, and reveals some of their activities (but still hiding [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]]'s true nature).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] comes to [[Places/Medieval Times\|Medieval Times]] and questions [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] about the party's actions and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. She successfully deflects his questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
