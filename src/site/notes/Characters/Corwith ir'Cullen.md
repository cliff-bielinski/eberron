| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |

Zelandris attempts to lie but is caught, and reveals some of their activities (but still hiding [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]]'s true nature).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
