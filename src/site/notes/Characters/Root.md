| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] reveals to the party he is not a student at [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]], and instead is an experimental warforged (alongside [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]]) that is able to forge a connection to other planes and draw on their powers. He is nervous about [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]'s interest in him. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reassures him that Merrix has progressive views about warforged autonomy. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]], [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and the twins head to the [[Places/Cogs\|Cogs]] and the [[Places/Red Hammer Inn\|Red Hammer Inn]]. Cinder introduces his party members to [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]]. They chastise Cinder in private about his indiscreet actions at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. There is a letter from [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]] asking Cinder to tour his premises. Cinder promises caution from now on.                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/001\|001]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] works his first day at the [[Places/Red Hammer Inn\|Red Hammer Inn]] in the [[Places/Cogs\|Cogs]]. He works for the warforged [[Characters/Crucible\|Crucible]] and [[Characters/Blue\|Blue]]. Cinder kicks back with fellow kinetic warforged [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]], as well as the anti-fleshy [[Characters/Scythe\|Scythe]]. He is invited to expand his horizons by seeing a play with the reforged [[Characters/Sprocket\|Sprocket]] and the playwright [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]].                                                          |
