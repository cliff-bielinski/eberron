After providing them food, Gristle asks for [[Characters/Chib\|Chib]], as to get in on the [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] that the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] were moving. Vicky points him to the nearby gargoyle [[Characters/Coldstone\|Coldstone]], who states the product has already been sold, but he would convey Gristle's interest to [[Characters/Cazha\|Cazha]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | #SayNoToDrugs At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] returns and is coaxed back into Lark with some tatertots from [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s canonical chest oven. She updates the party about the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] suggests they murder some Daask. The rest of the party is horrified and worried about retribution from a criminal gang. Jacopo is more concerned that [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] might kill him if this situation is not quickly rectified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                                                                                                               |

She explains her Gristle identity as a deceased Daask agent. The party questions her true age and origin. She is unsure of her actual age, but states she is from [[Lore/The Autumn Court\|Court of Thalia]] in [[Places/Thelanis\|Thelanis]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |

[[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] apologizes for calling in the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] early, but is reassured by Captain Buchanan. Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning.                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets up with the Party the following morning. She explains her suspicion that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is innocent and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] may have a hidden agenda. She plans to track [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] under the pretext of providing sustenance. She warns [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] to avoid [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]. The party is somewhat skeptical of Lark's supposition that the King's Swords are up to something nefarious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

After passing a few statues she finds [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Olladra]] and stabs it. She gets a vision of a wasteland with obsidian spires, reminiscent of a feyspire like the elvish birthplace [[Places/Shae Tirias Tolai\|Shae Tirias Tolai]]. Lark realizes the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] might be in a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabaran]] manifest zone. She drinks more blood and sees a vision of the [[Lore/The Autumn Court\|Court of Thalia]] with its flowers wilting and creatures turning to dust. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] arrives and stops her from stabbing the statue over and over again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

[[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] volunteer alongside a third.

Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation.                                                                                   |

In his apartment, they find a set up game of Conqueror, financial documents, a [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] book and a dagger that doubles as a key to a hidden trapdoor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
