She updates the party about the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] suggests they murder some Daask. The rest of the party is horrified and worried about retribution from a criminal gang. Jacopo is more concerned that [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] might kill him if this situation is not quickly rectified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party is interviewed by [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. They admit to breaking into [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment and infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs #BoromarClan [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] tells the party he started a brothel called the [[Places/Three-Legged Halfling\|Three-Legged Halfling]] in [[Places/Kalazart\|Kalazart]] alongside his former lover [[Characters/Mercedes Boromar\|Mercedes Boromar]]. She presumably died in the [[Lore/Day of Mourning\|Day of Mourning]]. Jacopo leveraged that relationship to get in with her cousin [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]]. Jacopo reveals he owes Gus both money and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] after being mugged by "unknown" enemies. The party brainstorms how to handle Gus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                                                                                                               |

[[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs #BoromarClan [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] laments the absence of [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] product being moved in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] admits he got jacked of his dreamlily and has been unable to develop a clientele in Highwall. Gus demands that Jacopo focus on the dreamlily situation once [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] is dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

She explains her Gristle identity as a deceased Daask agent. The party questions her true age and origin. She is unsure of her actual age, but states she is from [[Lore/The Autumn Court\|Court of Thalia]] in [[Places/Thelanis\|Thelanis]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #HouseMedani #KingsSwords The party encounters [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. She shakes [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]'s hand. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] flirts with [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and they arrange a "spar" later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

He sees the aberrant marked tyrant [[Characters/Halas Tarkanan\|Halas Tarkanan]], with Sharn teeming with vermin from the [[Characters/Lady of the Plague\|Lady of the Plague]].

Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]].
