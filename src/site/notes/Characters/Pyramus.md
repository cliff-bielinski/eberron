| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #ThePlightOfPyramus #Daask [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] becomes worried when [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] doesn't return to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. She transforms into Gristle and heads to [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]], where she meets with Gristle's [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] contacts. She is unable to find out anything useful.                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #TerrorInSharn #ThePlightOfPyramus The Sharn Inquisitive is delivered covering the undead attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. It also mentions the arrest of a warforged for killing a man. The Party infers that it is a reference to [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] and Jonas, the man previously detained in [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #ThePlightOfPyramus [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] disguises herself as [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]] and travels to a [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] garrison to gather intel. She speaks with [[Characters/Eskridge Callaway\|Eskridge Callaway]] and discovers [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] killed Jonas. Pyramus informed the Watch it was due to Jonas's imminent transformation into a ghoul, but provided no further exculpatory details.             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #ThePlightOfPyramus Back at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] gets [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]]'s advice on helping [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. He cautions her against a deceptive solution, given the differences between warforged and changelings.                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | #ThePlightOfPyramus After failed healing attempts, the Party ask [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] to take Jonas to a Jorasco house while they investigate the rest of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/002\|002]] | #TerrorInSharn The party (plus [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]], [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gus]], and [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]) head to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to decompress after the attack at the theatre. After some debate, they decide to open the bag of holding in an alleyway. Besides learning that the bag is of [[Lore/House Kundarak\|House Kundarak]] make, they find nothing but sloughed off rotten flesh.                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/001\|001]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] works his first day at the [[Places/Red Hammer Inn\|Red Hammer Inn]] in the [[Places/Cogs\|Cogs]]. He works for the warforged [[Characters/Crucible\|Crucible]] and [[Characters/Blue\|Blue]]. Cinder kicks back with fellow kinetic warforged [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]], as well as the anti-fleshy [[Characters/Scythe\|Scythe]]. He is invited to expand his horizons by seeing a play with the reforged [[Characters/Sprocket\|Sprocket]] and the playwright [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. |
