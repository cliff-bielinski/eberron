| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn As undead swarm into the inner cloister of the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] attempts to mind link with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]]. Not knowing it as friendly, he rebuffs her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #ManifestMayhem #ThePlightOfPyramus #BloodOfVol #KingsSwords [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] implores [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad") to find [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and preserve the [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] apologizes for calling in the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] early, but is reassured by Captain Buchanan. Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #HouseMedani #KingsSwords The party encounters [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. She shakes [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]'s hand. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] flirts with [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and they arrange a "spar" later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets up with the Party the following morning. She explains her suspicion that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is innocent and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] may have a hidden agenda. She plans to track [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] under the pretext of providing sustenance. She warns [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] to avoid [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]. The party is somewhat skeptical of Lark's supposition that the King's Swords are up to something nefarious.                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] meet up. Jacopo stabs a statue of [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] and drinks the blood. He has a vision of [[Places/Ja'Sharaat\|Ja'Sharaat]], the Dhakaani foundation of [[Places/Sharn\|Sharn]], being weathered and turned to dust. He sees the aberrant marked tyrant [[Characters/Halas Tarkanan\|Halas Tarkanan]], with Sharn teeming with vermin from the [[Characters/Lady of the Plague\|Lady of the Plague]]. Finally, he sees a future of Sharn derelict and empty. He collects some of Aureon's blood in a vial. Nazari stabs [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Dol Dorn]].                                                           |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] aids a cultist in killing some undead. After passing a few statues she finds [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Olladra]] and stabs it. She gets a vision of a wasteland with obsidian spires, reminiscent of a feyspire like the elvish birthplace [[Places/Shae Tirias Tolai\|Shae Tirias Tolai]]. Lark realizes the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] might be in a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabaran]] manifest zone. She drinks more blood and sees a vision of a fey court with its flowers wilting and creatures turning to dust. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] arrives and stops her from stabbing the statue over and over again. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] ask the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] assembly to all donate blood to perform a clarifying ritual over events that have recently transpired.  [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] slips [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] the vial of blood from the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] statue. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] pretends to faint, knocking over the basin of collected blood. When they insist on getting her blood, she hurls the basin at [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] and snaps her [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] coin.                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] is in trouble at [[Places/Medieval Times\|Medieval Times]], her place of work. Her boss [[Characters/Jasper Hoffman\|Jasper Hoffman]] chastises her for missing work. She also interacts with a few coworkers: [[Characters/Kessa Fitzpatrick\|Kessa Fitzpatrick]], [[Characters/Otis Lancaster\|Otis Lancaster]] and nasty goblin named [[Characters/Cuppersmug\|Cuppersmug]]. We learn Kessa has a thing for [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

He doesn't have much to offer in information, but vows to look into what sort of person may have sold the dragonshards to Wultram.                                                                         |
