| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] returns and is coaxed back into Lark with some tatertots from [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s canonical chest oven. She updates the party about the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] suggests they murder some Daask. The rest of the party is horrified and worried about retribution from a criminal gang. Jacopo is more concerned that [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] might kill him if this situation is not quickly rectified.                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | The party is separated as they enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. In addition to a lit candle and a dagger, each party member was given a phrase associated with a god of the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]. They discover that the undead wandering the Shrine avoid their candlelight, which seems magical and can't be augmented despite [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s best attempt.                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] wanders the dungeon, passing a few statues before meeting up with his friends. He stabs [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Onatar]] before joining with [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] ask the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] assembly to all donate blood to perform a clarifying ritual over events that have recently transpired.  [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] slips [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] the vial of blood from the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] statue. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] pretends to faint, knocking over the basin of collected blood. When they insist on getting her blood, she hurls the basin at [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] and snaps her [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] coin. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | Leaving [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]], the party finds [[Characters/Ignus\|Ignus]] a fire elemental from [[Places/Fernia\|Fernia]] likely pulled through the Fernian gate opened by Cinder. Ignus is excited by the prospect of joining a murder investigation and joins the party, gravitating toward Cinder due to his Fernian connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] reveals to the party he is not a student at [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]], and instead is an experimental warforged (alongside [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]]) that is able to forge a connection to other planes and draw on their powers. He is nervous about [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]'s interest in him. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reassures him that Merrix has progressive views about warforged autonomy.                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] and [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] are greeted by [[Characters/Pierce\|Pierce]] at [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]'s apartment. He brings them to Merrix. Cinder learns most of Merrix's immediate family was killed in Cyre during the Mourning. They talk about Kinetic Warforged, and Cinder lies saying he is the only one left. Cinder agrees to help Merrix from time to time at his factory. In return, Merrix promises to help [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] with his legal troubles.                                                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | At the [[Places/Red Hammer Inn\|Red Hammer Inn]], [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] approaches [[Characters/Scythe\|Scythe]] for information about [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. He learns about employee movement and a shift change to a "skeleton crew" that occurs at 8pm. Scythe also blames the party for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]'s predicament and demands "blood money" for Cinder keeping company with "slavers".                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] approaches [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and tries to reassure him that [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s secret about their kinetic powers is safe with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] questions [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] about his [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] cover story. Cinder expresses worry about drawing the attention of [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]. Talos reassures him of Merrix's progressive views toward Warforged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] is caught attempting to break into [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]]. He runs from the guards with no success in furthering the investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] returns to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]], where he reads a coded message from the Korranberg Chronicle using a cipher. He leaves a dossier concerning the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack at a dead drop location, only holding back concerns over [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s strange capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Cinder promises caution from now on.                                                                                                                                     |

The skulls are dispatched but the apartment lights on fire, forcing the group to flee as [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]] burns down with any remaining evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
