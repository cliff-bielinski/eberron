| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords The party and [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] regroup after the fight. [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning.                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] introduces Lady [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], a vampire (mommy), and requests three volunteers for blood to sustain her while she visits. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] volunteer alongside a third. Lan then asks the assembly to grieve [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] and asks the community to not cooperate with the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #TerrorInSharn #ThePlightOfPyramus The Sharn Inquisitive is delivered covering the undead attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. It also mentions the arrest of a warforged for killing a man. The Party infers that it is a reference to [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] and Jonas, the man previously detained in [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing Unable to cure Nazari's undead affliction, [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] visit [[Characters/Suyamun\|Suyamun]] at the Riedran embassy in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]] for help, where he successfully cleanses her disease. The twins tell Suyamun about their exploits at [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment, the [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]], and their interest in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. He doesn't have much to offer in information, but vows to look into what sort of person may have sold the dragonshards to Wultram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party arrive at [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] and find a crooked tower matching [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s address. They break in and find a pair of wooden cages: one, with a ghoul; and the other, with a gaunt man named Jonas. After questioning him, the Party realizes he had been captured and deliberately scratched by a ghoul. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] surmises this could be a Karrnathi attempt at creating self-replicating undead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | #ThePlightOfPyramus After failed healing attempts, the Party ask [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] to take Jonas to a Jorasco house while they investigate the rest of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They find a receipt for the bag and crossbow from a man named [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]], as well as a letter from Lan praising Wultram's service to Karrnathi ideals.
