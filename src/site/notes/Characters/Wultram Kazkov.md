[[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] volunteer alongside a third. Lan then asks the assembly to grieve [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] and asks the community to not cooperate with the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #TerrorInSharn #ThePlightOfPyramus The Sharn Inquisitive is delivered covering the undead attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. It also mentions the arrest of a warforged for killing a man. The Party infers that it is a reference to [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] and Jonas, the man previously detained in [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing Unable to cure Nazari's undead affliction, [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] visit [[Characters/Suyamun\|Suyamun]] at the Riedran embassy in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]] for help, where he successfully cleanses her disease. The twins tell Suyamun about their exploits at [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment, the [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]], and their interest in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. He doesn't have much to offer in information, but vows to look into what sort of person may have sold the dragonshards to Wultram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | #TerrorInSharn The Party arrive at [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] and find a crooked tower matching [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s address. They break in and find a pair of wooden cages: one, with a ghoul; and the other, with a gaunt man named Jonas. After questioning him, the Party realizes he had been captured and deliberately scratched by a ghoul. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] surmises this could be a Karrnathi attempt at creating self-replicating undead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | #ThePlightOfPyramus After failed healing attempts, the Party ask [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] to take Jonas to a Jorasco house while they investigate the rest of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

They find a receipt for the bag and crossbow from a man named [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]], as well as a letter from Lan praising Wultram's service to Karrnathi ideals.
