Lord ir'Cullen congratulates the party on the mission against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. He ignores the party's concern about the still-at-large [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and feels that Lan (and the cultists!) are definitely guilty. The party learns that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] (reportedly) killed himself shortly after confessing Lan's involvement in the plot. Buchanan reassures the party that the Shrine is under close guard. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] makes the connection that Lord ir'Cullen is [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]'s father.</li><li>Back at [[Places/Talos's Apartment\|Talos's Apartment]], the party discusses next steps. They theorize about [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s "suicide". Could it have been [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]? Or maybe the mysterious voice [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] heard in Wultram's head? Maybe it was just plain suicide. The Party strategizes about both how to approach the [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] interrogation as well as the [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] situation, including how to prioritize information-gathering versus killing her.</li></ul>                                                                                      |

[[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Talos d'Lyrandar\\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]].

[[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended.

They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack.
