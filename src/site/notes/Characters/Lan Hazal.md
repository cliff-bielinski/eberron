| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party head to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] and meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] and Lord [[Characters/Clayton ir'Cullen\|Clayton ir'Cullen]]. Lord ir'Cullen congratulates the party on the mission against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. He ignores the party's concern about the still-at-large [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and feels that Lan (and the cultists!) are definitely guilty. The party learns that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] (reportedly) killed himself shortly after confessing Lan's involvement in the plot. Buchanan reassures the party that the Shrine is under close guard. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] makes the connection that Lord ir'Cullen is [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]'s father.                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party agrees to an interview with [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]] in exchange for a supervised interrogation of [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party is interviewed by [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. They admit to breaking into [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]] and infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | Back at [[Places/Talos's Apartment\|Talos's Apartment]], the party discusses next steps. They theorize about [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s "suicide". Could it have been [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]? Or maybe the mysterious voice [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] heard in Wultram's head? Maybe it was just plain suicide. The Party strategizes about both how to approach the [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] interrogation as well as the [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] situation, including how to prioritize information-gathering versus killing her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | The party and [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] regroup after the fight. [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] implores [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad") to find [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and preserve the [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] apologizes for calling in the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] early, but is reassured by Captain Buchanan. Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning.                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets up with the Party the following morning. She explains her suspicion that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is innocent and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] may have a hidden agenda. She plans to track [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] under the pretext of providing sustenance. She warns [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] to avoid [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]. The party is somewhat skeptical of Lark's supposition that the King's Swords are up to something nefarious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | The party all present their bloodied daggers to gain access to a central cloister. The doors shut and undead can be heard gathering outside. [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] leads a chant and everybody drinks their dagger's blood, clearing their mental fog and the darkness of the [[Places/Mabar\|Mabaran]] manifest zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] introduces Lady [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], a vampire (mommy), and requests three volunteers for blood to sustain her while she visits. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] volunteer alongside a third. Lan then asks the assembly to grieve [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] and asks the community to not cooperate with the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] ask the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] assembly to all donate blood to perform a clarifying ritual over events that have recently transpired.  [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] slips [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] the vial of blood from the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] statue. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] pretends to faint, knocking over the basin of collected blood. When they insist on getting her blood, she hurls the basin at [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] and snaps her [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] coin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

[[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] attempts to apprehend [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] but he is thwarted as she shrouds the room in darkness, allowing the undead outside the door to gain strength and break into the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation.                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]] in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]].                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]] reverts [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] to Lark by punching her in the face. He and Lark then properly introduce themselves to the rest of the party. In an alley outside the tavern, the party smashes open [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe and finds only workers' wages in gold and silver and some small [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | The Party infiltrates [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. They discover the "skeleton crew" are actual skeletons. The crew is run by an undead minion called [[Characters/The Night Shift\|The Night Shift]] and his fiery gremlin Flicker. Using misdirection, the party successfully sneak past the undead and head to [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[Journal/Sessions/005\|005]] | The Party turns over [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office. They find a safe (which they take after failing to open it), a set of black robes and obsidian mask, and a letter to the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] discussing a midnight meeting at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. The Party finds more masks and robes and create a few distractions to escape [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] largely unnoticed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[Journal/Sessions/004\|004]] | The Party splits up. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] finds his Karrnathi drinking buddy [[Characters/Vlad\|Vlad]]. Talos finds out that the [[Lore/Order of the Emerald Claw\|Order of the Emerald Claw]] frequently conducted terror attacks in [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]]. He also learns that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is a Karrnathi industrialist who owns smelting facilities in the [[Places/Cogs\|Cogs]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The twins tell Suyamun about their exploits at [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]], the [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]], and their interest in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. He doesn't have much to offer in information, but vows to look into what sort of person may have sold the dragonshards to [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
