| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] introduces Lady [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], a vampire (mommy), and requests three volunteers for blood to sustain her while she visits. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] volunteer alongside a third. Lan then asks the assembly to grieve [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] and asks the community to not cooperate with the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]].      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The fleeing party members are chased by the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] militia, led by a man they would later recognize to be [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. The Party escape using feather tokens and jumping off a nearby bridge (except for [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], who shape changes to escape). They regroup at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. The rest of the Party questions how Lark was able to get away without jumping. |
