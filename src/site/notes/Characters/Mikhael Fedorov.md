| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords The party and [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] regroup after the fight. [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] introduces Lady [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], a vampire (mommy), and requests three volunteers for blood to sustain her while she visits. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] volunteer alongside a third. Lan then asks the assembly to grieve [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] and asks the community to not cooperate with the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | The fleeing party members are chased by the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] militia, led by a man they would later recognize to be [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. The Party escape using feather tokens and jumping off a nearby bridge (except for [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], who shape changes to escape). They regroup at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. The rest of the Party questions how Lark was able to get away without jumping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
