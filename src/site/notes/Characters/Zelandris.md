| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party is interviewed by [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. They admit to breaking into [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment and infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | #TerrorInSharn Back at [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment, the party discusses next steps. They theorize about [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s "suicide". Could it have been [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]? Or maybe the mysterious voice [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] heard in Wultram's head? Maybe it was just plain suicide. The Party strategizes about both how to approach the [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] interrogation as well as the [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] situation, including how to prioritize information-gathering versus killing her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s manor. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #VanquishingVampireMommy #BloodOfVol [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] additionally recalls that the term "Elder” refers to undead leaders of the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] faith such as vampires and liches, and in fact that the leader of the faith is a mummy lord based in [[Places/Atur\|Atur]]. Elders are respected for sacrificing their chance at divinity to become lasting spiritual leaders to their people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #ShadyShadow #HouseJorasco The party takes [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] to see [[Characters/Minka d'Jorasco\|Minka d'Jorasco]] after everything that went down at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. She gives him a clean bill of health except calls his missing shadow "probably some fey shit."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn #ShadyShadow [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] and [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] join up, assisting another cultist in destroying undead with their light. Talos finds his statue [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Arawai]] and stabs it. As darkness sweeps through the dungeon, Zelandris loses his shadow. The shadow briefly reappears to stab an undead hand. Zelandris stabs [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Boldrei]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

[[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognizes Lan's mask from [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] as a "psychopomp mask" to ward off death. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] talks about the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and their view of death as oblivion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
