| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords The party head to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] and meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] and Lord [[Characters/Clayton ir'Cullen\|Clayton ir'Cullen]]. Lord ir'Cullen congratulates the party on the mission against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. He ignores the party's concern about the still-at-large [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and feels that Lan (and the cultists!) are definitely guilty. The party learns that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] (reportedly) killed himself shortly after confessing Lan's involvement in the plot. Buchanan reassures the party that the Shrine is under close guard. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] makes the connection that Lord ir'Cullen is [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]'s father.                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | The party is interviewed by [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. They admit to breaking into [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]] and infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | #TerrorInSharn Back at [[Places/Talos's Apartment\|Talos's Apartment]], the party discusses next steps. They theorize about [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s "suicide". Could it have been [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]? Or maybe the mysterious voice [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] heard in Wultram's head? Maybe it was just plain suicide. The Party strategizes about both how to approach the [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] interrogation as well as the [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] situation, including how to prioritize information-gathering versus killing her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #SayNoToDrugs #VanquishingVampireMommy #BoromarClan The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs #BoromarClan [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] laments the absence of [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] product being moved in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] admits he got jacked of his dreamlily and has been unable to develop a clientele in Highwall. Gus demands that Jacopo focus on the dreamlily situation once [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] is dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords The party and [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] regroup after the fight. [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

[[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] apologizes for calling in the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] early, but is reassured by Captain Buchanan. Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning.                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets up with the Party the following morning. She explains her suspicion that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is innocent and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] may have a hidden agenda. She plans to track [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] under the pretext of providing sustenance. She warns [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] to avoid [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]. The party is somewhat skeptical of Lark's supposition that the King's Swords are up to something nefarious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
