| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation.                                     |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]] in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |
