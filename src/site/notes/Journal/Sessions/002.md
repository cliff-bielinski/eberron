## Aftermath in the Theatre
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] searches the raving mad man who unleashed the bag of undead in the theatre. He learns that the man is a Karrnathi named [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] attempts to mind link with Wultram and is rebuffed by an entity telling him he has no place in this man's mind.)
- (x:: #HouseCannith #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]] approaches [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos d'Lyrandar]] after the fight, where they comment on [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s unusual abilities and terrible lying. Merrix asks Talos to befriend Cinder. We also learn Talos lost his sister [[Characters/Zaria d'Lyrandar\|Zaria d'Lyrandar]] during the [[Lore/Day of Mourning\|Day of Mourning]].)
- (x:: #FeywardSoul [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets with the Elandrin playwright [[Characters/Luca\|Luca]] and attempts to discuss her theory that the [[Lore/Day of Mourning\|Day of Mourning]] disrupted Eberron's connection to [[Places/Thelanis\|Thelanis]]. Luca offers Lark tea and believes Lark will help her return to Thelanis. Luca becomes increasing erratic and shifts between her seasonal Elandrin forms.

The detectives are suspicious of the party after [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] mentions the now missing bag. [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gus]] pulls strings and convinces the guards to let the issue slide.)
## The Glum Gryphon
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The party (plus [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]], [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gus]], and [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]) head to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to decompress after the attack at the theatre. After some debate, they decide to open the bag of holding in an alleyway. Besides learning that the bag is of [[Lore/House Kundarak\|House Kundarak]] make, they find nothing but sloughed off rotten flesh.)
- (x:: #BoromarClan #TerrorInSharn  [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] asks the party to investigate [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s house in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], a Karrnathi neighborhood of [[Places/Middle Tavick's Landing\|Middle Tavick's Landing]].
