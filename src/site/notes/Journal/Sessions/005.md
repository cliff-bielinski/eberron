## The Stakeout
- (x:: At the [[Places/Red Hammer Inn\|Red Hammer Inn]], [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] approaches [[Characters/Scythe\|Scythe]] for information about [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. He learns about employee movement and a shift change to a "skeleton crew" that occurs at 8pm. Scythe also blames the party for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]'s predicament and demands "blood money" for Cinder keeping company with "slavers".)
- (x:: [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] approaches [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and tries to reassure him that [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s secret about their kinetic powers is safe with him.)
- (x:: The Party stakes out [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] and discuss strategy. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] reveals that she is a changeling, and transforms into a Karrnathi worker. The foreman (later known to be [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]]) lets her into the facility, but waits at the door for her return. She quickly heads upstairs and grabs a key and some documents from an office.  Bargast goes in after her and she changes into him in an attempt to leave. She creates confusion amongst the workers before morphing into Gristle and scampering off.)
## Whoever Smelt It
- (x:: [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] returns to the Party with the key and documents from [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. The documents include correspondence with [[Characters/Kelthor d'Tharashk\|Kelthor d'Tharashk]] negotiating the purchase of [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]].)
- (x:: The Party infiltrates [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. They discover the "skeleton crew" are actual skeletons. The crew is run by an undead minion called [[Characters/The Night Shift\|The Night Shift]] and his fiery gremlin Flicker. Using misdirection, the party successfully sneak past the undead and head to [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office.)
- (x:: The Party turns over [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s office. They find a safe (which they take after failing to open it), a set of black robes and obsidian mask, and a letter to the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] discussing a midnight meeting at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. The Party finds more masks and robes and create a few distractions to escape [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] largely unnoticed.)
