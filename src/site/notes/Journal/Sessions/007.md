## Great Cunningness
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn Back at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] reunites with the party and updates them. Some in the party recognize [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] as a Brelish war hero who lost his arm fighting Karrnathi. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reminds the party to **always lawyer up** when dealing with the authorities. The party debate what to do and decide to cooperate/negotiate with the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] in the ongoing investigation.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]].)
## Cloak and Dagger
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The party returns to [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment and plan to infiltrate [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] wonders if the discs given to them by the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] are being used to spy on the party.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], disguised as the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]], assists the party in successfully infiltrating [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. In his apartment, they find a set up game of Conqueror, financial documents, a [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] book and a dagger that doubles as a key to a hidden trapdoor.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn After leaving [[Characters/Ignus\|Ignus]] behind to exfiltrate himself, the party dons their robes and masks and enters a series of tunnels through the trapdoor. They join a growing stream of cultists. At the entrance to the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], each cultist is given a candle, a knife, and a cryptic message about rebellion against the gods. The party is separated and enter the Shrine.)
