## The Battle of Bloody Blade Shrine
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn As undead swarm into the inner cloister of the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] attempts to mind link with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]]. Not knowing it as friendly, he rebuffs her.)
- (x:: #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords The party and [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] regroup after the fight. [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #BloodyBladeBreakIn #ManifestMayhem #ThePlightOfPyramus #BloodOfVol #KingsSwords [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] implores [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad") to find [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and preserve the [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] apologizes for calling in the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] early, but is reassured by Captain Buchanan. Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.)
## Jailhouse and Jorasco
- (x:: #HouseMedani #KingsSwords The party encounters [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] in [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]]. She shakes [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]'s hand. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] flirts with [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and they arrange a "spar" later.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (as "Vlad" from the Old Country) talks with other [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] residents in jail. She learns nobody knew of [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] until that night. They are angry at Vampire Mommy for what happened at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], but still trust [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and believe the blood ritual would have revealed the truth of the terror attacks. Their opinions of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] are divided: some believing he was eccentric albeit harmless whilst others believed him erratic and insane. Lark takes away that the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] community was not responsible for the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. While skeptical of "Vlad", the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] eventually release Lark after questioning.)
- (x:: #ShadyShadow #HouseJorasco The party takes [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] to see [[Characters/Minka d'Jorasco\|Minka d'Jorasco]] after everything that went down at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. She gives him a clean bill of health except calls his missing shadow "probably some fey shit.")
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] meets up with the Party the following morning. She explains her suspicion that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is innocent and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] may have a hidden agenda. She plans to track [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] under the pretext of providing sustenance. She warns [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] to avoid [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]. The party is somewhat skeptical of Lark's supposition that the King's Swords are up to something nefarious.)
