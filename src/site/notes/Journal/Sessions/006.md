## Research and Revelations
- (x:: Leaving [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]], the party finds [[Characters/Ignus\|Ignus]] a fire elemental from [[Places/Fernia\|Fernia]] likely pulled through the Fernian gate opened by Cinder. Ignus is excited by the prospect of joining a murder investigation and joins the party, gravitating toward Cinder due to his Fernian connection.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]] reverts [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] to Lark by punching her in the face. He and Lark then properly introduce themselves to the rest of the party. In an alley outside the tavern, the party smashes open [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe and finds only workers' wages in gold and silver and some small [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]]. )
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #BloodOfVol The party head to [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment for the night, where they have an actual party. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognizes Lan's mask from [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] as a "psychopomp mask" to ward off death. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] talks about the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and their view of death as oblivion.)
- (x:: #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] reveals to the party he is not a student at [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]], and instead is an experimental warforged (alongside [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]]) that is able to forge a connection to other planes and draw on their powers. He is nervous about [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]'s interest in him. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] reassures him that Merrix has progressive views about warforged autonomy.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The following day, [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] heads to [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] library and researches the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. She doesn't find out much regarding shrines in [[Places/Sharn\|Sharn]] but learns about the importance of blood in Blood of Vol rituals. She also learns that Seekers rituals manage the destructive impact of [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zones.)
## Scrutiny from Above
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] is questioned by [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] of the King's Swords about his absence at work, the party's activities, and his knowledge of [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. Zelandris attempts to lie but is caught, and reveals some of their activities (but still hiding [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]]'s true nature).)
- (x:: [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] is in trouble at [[Places/Medieval Times\|Medieval Times]], her place of work. Her boss [[Characters/Jasper Hoffman\|Jasper Hoffman]] chastises her for missing work. She also interacts with a few coworkers: [[Characters/Kessa Fitzpatrick\|Kessa Fitzpatrick]], [[Characters/Otis Lancaster\|Otis Lancaster]] and nasty goblin named [[Characters/Cuppersmug\|Cuppersmug]]. We learn Kessa has a thing for [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] comes to [[Places/Medieval Times\|Medieval Times]] and questions [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] about the party's actions and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. She successfully deflects his questions.)
- (x:: #KineticCuriosity #ThePlightOfPyramus [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] and [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] are greeted by [[Characters/Pierce\|Pierce]] at [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]'s apartment. He brings them to Merrix. Cinder learns most of Merrix's immediate family was killed in Cyre during the Mourning. They talk about Kinetic Warforged, and Cinder lies saying he is the only one left. Cinder agrees to help Merrix from time to time at his factory. In return, Merrix promises to help [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] with his legal troubles.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] learns he is a person of interest in the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attack. He answers a summons from the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] for questioning.)
