## Stabby Statues
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn The party is separated as they enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. In addition to a lit candle and a dagger, each party member was given a phrase associated with a god of the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]. They discover that the undead wandering the Shrine avoid their candlelight, which seems magical and can't be augmented despite [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s best attempt.)
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn #ShadyShadow [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] and [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] join up, assisting another cultist in destroying undead with their light. Talos finds his statue [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Arawai]] and stabs it. As darkness sweeps through the dungeon, Zelandris loses his shadow. The shadow briefly reappears to stab an undead hand. Zelandris stabs [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Boldrei]].)
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] wanders the dungeon, passing a few statues before meeting up with his friends. He stabs [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Onatar]] before joining with [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].)
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] meet up. Jacopo stabs a statue of [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] and drinks the blood. He has a vision of [[Places/Ja'Sharaat\|Ja'Sharaat]], the Dhakaani foundation of [[Places/Sharn\|Sharn]], being weathered and turned to dust. He sees the aberrant marked tyrant [[Characters/Halas Tarkanan\|Halas Tarkanan]], with Sharn teeming with vermin from the [[Characters/Lady of the Plague\|Lady of the Plague]]. Finally, he sees a future of Sharn derelict and empty. He collects some of Aureon's blood in a vial. Nazari stabs [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Dol Dorn]].)
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] aids a cultist in killing some undead. After passing a few statues she finds [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Olladra]] and stabs it. She gets a vision of a wasteland with obsidian spires, reminiscent of a feyspire like the elvish birthplace [[Places/Shae Tirias Tolai\|Shae Tirias Tolai]]. Lark realizes the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] might be in a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabaran]] manifest zone. She drinks more blood and sees a vision of a fey court with its flowers wilting and creatures turning to dust. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] arrives and stops her from stabbing the statue over and over again.)
## Vampire Mommy
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn The party all present their bloodied daggers to gain access to a central cloister. The doors shut and undead can be heard gathering outside. [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] leads a chant and everybody drinks their dagger's blood, clearing their mental fog and the darkness of the [[Places/Mabar\|Mabaran]] manifest zone.)
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] introduces Lady [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], a vampire (mommy), and requests three volunteers for blood to sustain her while she visits. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] volunteer alongside a third. Lan then asks the assembly to grieve [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] and asks the community to not cooperate with the [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]].)
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] ask the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] assembly to all donate blood to perform a clarifying ritual over events that have recently transpired.  [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] slips [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] the vial of blood from the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Aureon]] statue. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] pretends to faint, knocking over the basin of collected blood. When they insist on getting her blood, she hurls the basin at [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] and snaps her [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] coin.)
- (x:: #BloodyBladeBreakIn #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] and the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] pop into the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. They arrest cultists including [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] attempts to apprehend [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] but he is thwarted as she shrouds the room in darkness, allowing the undead outside the door to gain strength and break into the room.)
