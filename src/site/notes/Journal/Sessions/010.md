## The Lilypad
- (x:: [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] tells the party he started a brothel called the [[Places/Three-Legged Halfling\|Three-Legged Halfling]] in [[Places/Kalazart\|Kalazart]] alongside his former lover [[Characters/Mercedes Boromar\|Mercedes Boromar]]. She presumably died in the [[Lore/Day of Mourning\|Day of Mourning]]. Jacopo leveraged that relationship to get in with her cousin [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]]. Jacopo reveals he owes Gus both money and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] after being mugged by "unknown" enemies. The party brainstorms how to handle Gus.)
- (x:: The party discusses next steps with the investigation. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] suggests disguising herself as [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to get into [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] expresses discomfort with Lark's willingness to offer herself to [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]], while Lark reminds Nazari of the mistakes she made at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. While discussing support for this operation, Nazari and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] disclose their psionic abilities. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognize the powers as common amongst the ruling elite in the [[Lore/Unity of Riedra\|Unity of Riedra]]. Zelandris mentions the voice that rebuffed him when he tried to mind link with [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].)
- (x:: The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission.)
- (x:: [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] laments the absence of [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] product being moved in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] admits he got jacked of his dreamlily and has been unable to develop a clientele in Highwall. Gus demands that Jacopo focus on the dreamlily situation once [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] is dealt with.)
- (x:: [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] offers to help [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] investigate the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] supply of [[Lore/Boromar Clan\|Boromar]] [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. She explains her Gristle identity as a deceased Daask agent. The party questions her true age and origin. She is unsure of her actual age, but states she is from [[Lore/The Autumn Court\|Court of Thalia]] in [[Places/Thelanis\|Thelanis]].)
## Library Day
- (x:: The party heads to [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] to research vampires. They learn vampire spawn are created and controlled by existing vampires; that they have weaknesses to sunlight but are immune to disease, paralysis, and sleep; they are resistant to ordinary weapons, but are affected by silver blades; that they can quickly restore their health; that they rest in coffins; that they are only rejuvenated by drinking blood directly from a person that they haven’t already fed from within the last few days; that they can turn into bats, wolves, or mist; that they can dominate others; and that transforming into a spawn requires a ritual performed upon a person killed by a vampire bite.)
- (x:: [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] additionally recalls that the term "Elder” refers to undead leaders of the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] faith such as vampires and liches, and in fact that the leader of the faith is a mummy lord based in [[Places/Atur\|Atur]]. Elders are respected for sacrificing their chance at divinity to become lasting spiritual leaders to their people.)
