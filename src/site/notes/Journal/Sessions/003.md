## Breaking and Entering
- (x:: The Party take sky coaches to [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], a Karrnathi enclave within [[Places/Middle Tavick's Landing\|Middle Tavick's Landing]]. In transit, members of the party learn that [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] hates "gobos" and that [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] fought for Cyre - on opposite sides of the War to [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]].)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The Party arrive at [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] and find a crooked tower matching [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s address. They break in and find a pair of wooden cages: one, with a ghoul; and the other, with a gaunt man named Jonas. After questioning him, the Party realizes he had been captured and deliberately scratched by a ghoul. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] surmises this could be a Karrnathi attempt at creating self-replicating undead.)
- (x:: #ThePlightOfPyramus After failed healing attempts, the Party ask [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] to take Jonas to a Jorasco house while they investigate the rest of [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #HouseDeneith #OrderOfTheEmeraldClaw The Party discovers that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] was a former Blademark of [[Lore/House Deneith\|House Deneith]]. They find a receipt for the bag and crossbow from a man named [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]], as well as a letter from Lan praising Wultram's service to Karrnathi ideals. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] finds a pendant of the [[Lore/Order of the Emerald Claw\|Order of the Emerald Claw]] and a manifesto espousing Karrnathi supremacy and calling for a return to war.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The Party find a spellbook alongside three large [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]] in [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment: an Eberron, a Siberys and a Khyber dragonshard. They surmise this was a ritual for summoning undead.)
## Fight and Flight
- (x:: #battle #TerrorInSharn [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] steps through the summoning circle and three flaming skulls animate and attack the Party. The skulls are dispatched but the apartment lights on fire, forcing the group to flee as [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s home burns down with any remaining evidence.)
- (x:: The fleeing party members are chased by the [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]] militia, led by a man they would later recognize to be [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. The Party escape using feather tokens and jumping off a nearby bridge (except for [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]], who shape changes to escape). They regroup at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. The rest of the Party questions how Lark was able to get away without jumping.)
- (x:: The Party splits up for the night. [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] stay at [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] attempts to heal [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]]'s ghoul wound at their run-down apartment. At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] plays a traditional Cyran song to comfort [[Characters/Angelica Mediri\|Angelica Mediri]].)
