## Never Split the Party
- (x:: #ThePlightOfPyramus #Daask [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] becomes worried when [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] doesn't return to the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]]. She transforms into Gristle and heads to [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]], where she meets with Gristle's [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] contacts. She is unable to find out anything useful.)
- (x:: #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] questions [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] about his [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] cover story. Cinder expresses worry about drawing the attention of [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]]. Talos reassures him of Merrix's progressive views toward warforged.)
- (x:: #SayNoToDrugs [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] questions [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] about his relationship to [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]], and why Gus is interested in the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack. Jacopo suggests Gus is interested in the greater good of Sharn.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #ThePlightOfPyramus The Sharn Inquisitive is delivered covering the undead attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. It also mentions the arrest of a warforged for killing a man. The Party infers that it is a reference to [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] and Jonas, the man previously detained in [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #OrderOfTheEmeraldClaw The Party splits up. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] finds his Karrnathi drinking buddy [[Characters/Vlad\|Vlad]]. Talos finds out that the [[Lore/Order of the Emerald Claw\|Order of the Emerald Claw]] frequently conducted terror attacks in [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]]. He also learns that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is a Karrnathi industrialist who owns smelting facilities in the [[Places/Cogs\|Cogs]].)
- (x:: [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] is caught attempting to break into [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]]. He runs from the guards with no success in furthering the investigation.)
- (x:: #InternationalManOfMystery [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] returns to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]], where he reads a coded message from the Korranberg Chronicle using a cipher. He leaves a dossier concerning the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] attack at a dead drop location, only holding back concerns over [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s strange capabilities.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #ItsATwinThing Unable to cure Nazari's undead affliction, [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] and [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] visit [[Characters/Suyamun\|Suyamun]] at the Riedran embassy in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]] for help, where he successfully cleanses her disease. The twins tell Suyamun about their exploits at [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment, the [[Lore/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]], and their interest in [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]. He doesn't have much to offer in information, but vows to look into what sort of person may have sold the dragonshards to Wultram.)
- (x:: #ThePlightOfPyramus [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] disguises herself as [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]] and travels to a [[Lore/Sharn City Watch\|Sharn City Watch]] garrison to gather intel. She speaks with [[Characters/Eskridge Callaway\|Eskridge Callaway]] and discovers [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]] killed Jonas. Pyramus informed the Watch it was due to Jonas's imminent transformation into a ghoul, but provided no further exculpatory details.)
## Reconvene and the Red Hammer Inn
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The Party reconvenes at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]] to share their findings. They speculate the attack at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] could have been an attempt to plant the seeds of an undead outbreak in the city.)
- (x:: #KineticCuriosity [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]], [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and the twins head to the [[Places/Cogs\|Cogs]] and the [[Places/Red Hammer Inn\|Red Hammer Inn]]. Cinder introduces his party members to [[Characters/Boreal\|Boreal]] and [[Characters/Root\|Root]]. They chastise Cinder in private about his indiscreet actions at the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]]. There is a letter from [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]] asking Cinder to tour his premises. Cinder promises caution from now on.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The Party speaks to [[Characters/Blue\|Blue]], who gives them the location of [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s smelting facility. He also warns them that Lan only hires Karrnathi and that there are rumors that he uses an undead workforce.)
- (x:: #ThePlightOfPyramus Back at the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] gets [[Characters/Grimnir\|Grimnir]]'s advice on helping [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. He cautions her against a deceptive solution, given the differences between warforged and changelings.)
