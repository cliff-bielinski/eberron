> [!note] Daddy Lies, Mommy Hides
> Episode 11 was the hardest episode yet to give a title. I considered "Thots and Tatertots," in honor of Nazari and Corwith's "duel" and Cinder bribing Gristle with some tatertots from his chest oven. But totwise, that chest oven ain't canon, and plotwise, there were bigger fish to fry. For instance -- why the heck isn't Lord ir'Cullen at all concerned about Lady Tarra'az? Ask the important questions in "Daddy Lies, Mommy Hides"!

## Thots and Tatertots
- (x:: #SayNoToDrugs #Daask [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] heads to [[Places/The Dribbling Mug\|The Dribbling Mug]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]], where he encounters the goblin street urchin [[Characters/Vicky\|Vicky]] and shifter [[Characters/Scritch\|Scritch]]. After providing them food, Gristle asks for [[Characters/Chib\|Chib]], as to get in on the [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] that the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] were moving. Vicky points him to the nearby gargoyle [[Characters/Coldstone\|Coldstone]], who states the product has already been sold, but he would convey Gristle's interest to [[Characters/Cazha\|Cazha]].)
- (x:: #KingsSwords [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] arrives at [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]]'s apartment, bringing an invitation for the party from [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]]. The two of them spar with wooden swords before banging.)
- (x:: #SayNoToDrugs At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Characters/Lark\|Gristle]] returns and is coaxed back into Lark with some tatertots from [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s canonical chest oven. She updates the party about the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] suggests they murder some Daask. The rest of the party is horrified and worried about retribution from a criminal gang. Jacopo is more concerned that [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] might kill him if this situation is not quickly rectified.)
## Heroes of the City?
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords The party head to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] and meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] and Lord [[Characters/Clayton ir'Cullen\|Clayton ir'Cullen]]. Lord ir'Cullen congratulates the party on the mission against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. He ignores the party's concern about the still-at-large [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and feels that Lan (and the cultists!) are definitely guilty. The party learns that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] (reportedly) killed himself shortly after confessing Lan's involvement in the plot. Buchanan reassures the party that the Shrine is under close guard. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] makes the connection that Lord ir'Cullen is [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]'s father.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn The party agrees to an interview with [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]] in exchange for a supervised interrogation of [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]].)
- (x:: The party is interviewed by [[Characters/Monty Applebee\|Monty Applebee]]. They admit to breaking into [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s apartment and infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disputes the notion that the investigation is finished with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s arrest. They bring up [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] as an open question and the possibility of a larger conspiracy. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] tries to backpedal on this notion. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] secures [[Lore/Wildnight\|Wildnight]] advertising for [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] in exchange for giving Applebee a juicy quote for the paper.)
- (x:: #TerrorInSharn Back at [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment, the party discusses next steps. They theorize about [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s "suicide". Could it have been [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]? Or maybe the mysterious voice [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] heard in Wultram's head? Maybe it was just plain suicide. The Party strategizes about both how to approach the [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] interrogation as well as the [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] situation, including how to prioritize information-gathering versus killing her.)
