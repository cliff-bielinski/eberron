| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |

[[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]].

Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #BloodOfVol The party head to [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]]'s apartment for the night, where they have an actual party. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] recognizes Lan's mask from [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] as a "psychopomp mask" to ward off death. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] talks about the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] and their view of death as oblivion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

She doesn't find out much regarding shrines in [[Places/Sharn\|Sharn]] but learns about the importance of blood in Blood of Vol rituals. She also learns that Seekers rituals manage the destructive impact of [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
