| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs #BoromarClan [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] tells the party he started a brothel called the [[Places/Three-Legged Halfling\|Three-Legged Halfling]] in [[Places/Kalazart\|Kalazart]] alongside his former lover [[Characters/Mercedes Boromar\|Mercedes Boromar]]. She presumably died in the [[Lore/Day of Mourning\|Day of Mourning]]. Jacopo leveraged that relationship to get in with her cousin [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]]. Jacopo reveals he owes Gus both money and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] after being mugged by "unknown" enemies. The party brainstorms how to handle Gus.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #TerrorInSharn #SayNoToDrugs #VanquishingVampireMommy #BoromarClan The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs #BoromarClan [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] laments the absence of [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] product being moved in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] admits he got jacked of his dreamlily and has been unable to develop a clientele in Highwall. Gus demands that Jacopo focus on the dreamlily situation once [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] is dealt with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #SayNoToDrugs [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] offers to help [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] investigate the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] supply of [[Lore/Boromar Clan\|Boromar]] [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. She explains her Gristle identity as a deceased Daask agent. The party questions her true age and origin. She is unsure of her actual age, but states she is from [[Lore/The Autumn Court\|Court of Thalia]] in [[Places/Thelanis\|Thelanis]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
