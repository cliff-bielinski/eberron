After providing them food, Gristle asks for [[Characters/Chib\|Chib]], as to get in on the [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] that the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] were moving. Vicky points him to the nearby gargoyle [[Characters/Coldstone\|Coldstone]], who states the product has already been sold, but he would convey Gristle's interest to [[Characters/Cazha\|Cazha]].</li><li>At the [[Places/Glum Gryphon\|Glum Gryphon]], [[Lark\\|Gristle]] returns and is coaxed back into Lark with some tatertots from [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s canonical chest oven. She updates the party about the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] suggests they murder some Daask. The rest of the party is horrified and worried about retribution from a criminal gang. Jacopo is more concerned that [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] might kill him if this situation is not quickly rectified.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

She presumably died in the [[Lore/Day of Mourning\|Day of Mourning]]. Jacopo leveraged that relationship to get in with her cousin [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]]. Jacopo reveals he owes Gus both money and [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] after being mugged by "unknown" enemies. The party brainstorms how to handle Gus.</li><li>The party meets with [[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] at the [[Places/Lilypad\|Lilypad]] in [[Places/Callestan\|Callestan]] in [[Places/Lower Dura\|Lower Dura]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission.</li><li>[[Characters/Gustavo\|Gustavo]] laments the absence of [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]] product being moved in [[Places/High Walls\|High Walls]]. [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] admits he got jacked of his dreamlily and has been unable to develop a clientele in Highwall. Gus demands that Jacopo focus on the dreamlily situation once [[Jessel Tarra'az\\|Vampire Mommy]] is dealt with.</li><li>[[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] offers to help [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] investigate the [[Lore/Daask\|Daask]] supply of [[Boromar Clan\\|Boromar]] [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. She explains her Gristle identity as a deceased Daask agent. The party questions her true age and origin. She is unsure of her actual age, but states she is from [[The Autumn Court\\|Court of Thalia]] in [[Places/Thelanis\|Thelanis]].</li></ul> |
