| [[Journal/Sessions/011\|011]] | (x:: The party head to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] and meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] and Lord [[Characters/Clayton ir'Cullen\|Clayton ir'Cullen]]. Lord ir'Cullen congratulates the party on the mission against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] at the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. He ignores the party's concern about the still-at-large [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] and feels that Lan (and the cultists!) are definitely guilty. The party learns that [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]] (reportedly) killed himself shortly after confessing Lan's involvement in the plot. Buchanan reassures the party that the Shrine is under close guard. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] makes the connection that Lord ir'Cullen is [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]]'s father.)                                                                                                                                      |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | (x:: Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over.) |
| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | (x:: The party and [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] regroup after the fight. [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

[[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] thanks the party for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] and promises a good word for [[Characters/Pyramus\|Pyramus]]. [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] apologizes for calling in the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] early, but is reassured by Captain Buchanan. Lark is arrested alongside the rest of the cultists as the party leaves.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation.)                                                                                     |

Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence.
