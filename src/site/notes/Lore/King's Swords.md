| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] goes to the [[Places/King's Swords Garrison\|King's Swords Garrison]] in [[Places/Upper Central\|Upper Central]], where he questioned by [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]] and [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] about the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attacks and the party's involvement thus far. Jacopo attempts to lie stating a man of "great cunningness", possibly named Castor, stole [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]]'s missing bag of holding. They see through his deception and Jacopo eventually folds. He tells them everything except for the twins' psionic abilities, that [[Characters/Lark\|Contessina]] is a changeling, or that they burglarized [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]]'s safe at [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]]. Jacopo learns that war hero Captain [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] is spearheading the investigation.                           |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] head to [[Places/Truffs n Stuff\|Truffs n Stuff]] to hand over the party's collected evidence. Jacopo hands it over, but withholds the letter from the foreman [[Characters/Bargast\|Bargast]] or the list of [[Places/Hazal Smelting\|Hazal Smelting]] employees' addresses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords #HouseDeneith #HouseMedani The party meets with [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], [[Characters/Constance d'Medani\|Constance d'Medani]], [[Characters/Viktor d'Deneith\|Viktor d'Deneith]] and [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] to negotiate terms. Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]]. |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] is questioned by [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] of the King's Swords about his absence at work, the party's activities, and his knowledge of [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. Zelandris attempts to lie but is caught, and reveals some of their activities (but still hiding [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]]'s true nature).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Corwith ir'Cullen\|Corwith ir'Cullen]] comes to [[Places/Medieval Times\|Medieval Times]] and questions [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] about the party's actions and [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]]. She successfully deflects his questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[Journal/Sessions/006\|006]] | #TerrorInSharn #KingsSwords [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] learns he is a person of interest in the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]] terror attack. He answers a summons from the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] for questioning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
