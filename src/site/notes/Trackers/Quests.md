Buchanan offers the party amnesty for prior actions in exchange for infiltrating the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. Buchanan wants the party for this task so that the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] have plausible deniability if things go sour. He gives them "discs" to snap if the city is in danger which will summon King's Swords to their location. He also gives them 200 gold to help finance the infiltration. Buchanan allows the party to review the existing evidence. He is unsure where the Shrine is but knows that [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] has been staying at his apartment in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]].                                     |

In his apartment, they find a set up game of Conqueror, financial documents, a [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] book and a dagger that doubles as a key to a hidden trapdoor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

At the entrance to the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], each cultist is given a candle, a knife, and a cryptic message about rebellion against the gods.

> | [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | #BloodyBladeBreakIn The party is separated as they enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]]. In addition to a lit candle and a dagger, each party member was given a phrase associated with a god of the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]. They discover that the undead wandering the Shrine avoid their candlelight, which seems magical and can't be augmented despite [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]]'s best attempt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

> | [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | #battle #BloodyBladeBreakIn #KingsSwords #BloodOfVol Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over. |

[[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]] escapes while [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is apprehended. The party updates [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Captain Buchanan]], emphasizing: (1) there was a blood ritual involving [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]]; (2) Lan demanded secrecy in a coming "war"; (3) the ritual to enter the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] blasphemed the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]]; (4) the Shrine is a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabar]] manifest zone; (5) the cultists mourned [[Characters/Wultram Kazkov\|Wultram Kazkov]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

[[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing. Gus promises some assistance in provisioning supplies for the mission.                                                                                                   |
> | [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #VanquishingVampireMommy The party heads to [[Places/Morgrave University\|Morgrave University]] to research vampires. They learn vampire spawn are created and controlled by existing vampires; that they have weaknesses to sunlight but are immune to disease, paralysis, and sleep; they are resistant to ordinary weapons, but are affected by silver blades; that they can quickly restore their health; that they rest in coffins; that they are only rejuvenated by drinking blood directly from a person that they haven’t already fed from within the last few days; that they can turn into bats, wolves, or mist; that they can dominate others; and that transforming into a spawn requires a ritual performed upon a person killed by a vampire bite. |
> | [[Journal/Sessions/010\|010]] | #VanquishingVampireMommy #BloodOfVol [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] additionally recalls that the term "Elder” refers to undead leaders of the [[Lore/Blood of Vol\|Blood of Vol]] faith such as vampires and liches, and in fact that the leader of the faith is a mummy lord based in [[Places/Atur\|Atur]]. Elders are respected for sacrificing their chance at divinity to become lasting spiritual leaders to their people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
