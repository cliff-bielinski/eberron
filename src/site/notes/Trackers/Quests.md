[[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] pays Gus his first installment for the lost [[Lore/Dreamlily\|Dreamlily]]. They update Gus about their investigation. He believes the evidence against [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] is flimsy, but is skeptical that a grander conspiracy to bring [[Places/Breland\|Breland]] and [[Places/Karrnath\|Karrnath]] to war might be at play. He offers a reward for [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]]'s head, assuming they can also provide evidence of her wrongdoing.

They learn vampire spawn are created and controlled by existing vampires; that they have weaknesses to sunlight but are immune to disease, paralysis, and sleep; they are resistant to ordinary weapons, but are affected by silver blades; that they can quickly restore their health; that they rest in coffins; that they are only rejuvenated by drinking blood directly from a person that they havenโt already fed from within the last few days; that they can turn into bats, wolves, or mist; that they can dominate others; and that transforming into a spawn requires a ritual performed upon a person killed by a vampire bite.) |
