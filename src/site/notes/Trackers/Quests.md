> | [[Journal/Sessions/007\|007]] | The party agrees to infiltrate the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]] on behalf of the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. They are given "discs" to snap in case of trouble. The party heads to [[Places/The Hazal Residence\|The Hazal Residence]] in [[Places/Graywall\|Graywall]], where they enter a trapdoor leading to the Shrine. They dress up as cultists and are given a candle, a knife, and a cryptic message before being separated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
> | [[Journal/Sessions/008\|008]] | Disguised as cultists, the party is separated from one another. They wander the [[Places/Bloody Blade Shrine\|Bloody Blade Shrine]], using the light from their candles to keep the undead at bay. There are statues of the [[Lore/Sovereign Host\|Sovereign Host]] deities throughout the Shrine. The party members each find the statue associated with their cryptic message and stab the statue, causing it to bleed. [[Characters/Talos d'Lyrandar\|Talos]] stabs Arawei; [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] stabs Boldrei; [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] stabs Onatar; [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] stabs Aureon; [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] stabs Dol Dorn; [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] stabs Olladra. Jacopo drinks the blood and gets visions of [[Places/Ja'Sharaat\|Ja'Sharaat]] and the aberrant marked tyrants that placed death curses upon [[Old Sharn\|Old Sharn]]. Lark also drinks the blood and gets visions of [[Lore/The Autumn Court\|the Court of Thalia]]. She recognizes the shrine is in a [[Places/Mabar\|Mabaran]] manifest zone. They present their bloodied knives to gain access to the central cloister of the Shrine. The meeting with [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Jessel Tarra'az]] unfolds until [[Characters/Nazari\|Nazari]] disrupts an attempted blood ritual and summons the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]] with her snapped "disc." |
