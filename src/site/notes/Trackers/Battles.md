| [[Journal/Sessions/009\|009]] | (x:: Battle breaks out between the undead and the party alongside the [[Lore/King's Swords\|King's Swords]]. Huddled cultists light magical candles and attempt to deliver light to braziers to drive back the undead. The party uses that light to help fight off the undead. Captain Buchanan is charmed by [[Characters/Jessel Tarra'az\|Vampire Mommy]] to cut down one of his own King's Swords. The King's Swords initially attack the cultists, but [[Characters/Jacopo\|Jacopo]] persuades them to stop. [[Characters/Lark\|Lark]] (disguised as "Vlad") helps [[Characters/Lan Hazal\|Lan Hazal]] and [[Characters/Mikhael Fedorov\|Mikhael Fedorov]]. [[Characters/Alastair Buchanan\|Alastair Buchanan]] also helps clear a path for Lan to bolster the flames from the braziers. [[Characters/Zelandris\|Zelandris]] nearly dies from a massive, severed hand and necril worms, but is saved by Jacopo. Two cultists and two King's Swords die before the battle is over.) |
| [[Journal/Sessions/003\|003]] | [[Characters/Cinder\|Cinder]] steps through a summoning circle at [[Places/Wultram's Apartment\|Wultram's Apartment]] and three flaming skulls animate and attack the party. The skulls are defeated but the house burns down in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Journal/Sessions/001\|001]] | The party, alongside [[Characters/Merrix d'Cannith\|Merrix d'Cannith]], fight undead unleashed by a crazed man in the [[Places/Diamond Theatre\|Diamond Theatre]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
